Description: CS362 Assignment 5 - Bugs in Teammate's Code

---------

1. Adventurer Card: 

	- Bug: Incorrect number of treasure cards gained for all three conditions

	- Description: Current player draws incorrect number of treasure cards from deck, discard, or 
	both piles for all three possible conditions:
		- When there are 2 treasure cards to be gained, player should result in one extra card in 
		hand after having discarded the played card.
		- When there is just 1 treasure card to be gained, player’s hand count should remain the 
		same after having discarded the played Adventurer card.
		- When there are no treasure cards to be gained, player’s hand count should be one less 
		after having played the card.

	- Method(s) of bug discovery:
		- Unit test – The unit test conducted showed that the function fails to provide correct 
		number of hand count for all three conditions.  No other bugs were detected.
		- Random test – Out of the 1000 tests conducted, only 2 tests were successful (1 from 
		cardEffect() and 1 from adventurerEffect(). The function has a 99.8% failure rate. 

	- Cause(s): One bug discovered in adventurerEffect() is that when incrementing the number of 
	drawn treasure cards, the function adds 2 cards to the count at a time despite having drawn 
	just  one treasure card. As a result, the program does not continue to look for a second 
	treasure card to add to the player’s hand.

			if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
				drawntreasure = drawntreasure + 2;

	- Effect(s): Player ends up with incorrect hand count.

2. Smithy Card: 

	- Bug: One extra card is discovered in hand after having played Smithy card

	- Description: Current player draws incorrect number of new cards from deck. Smithy card 
	requires the player to draw 3 cards from deck, resulting in 2 additional cards in the final 
	hand count after having discarded the played Smithy card. 

	- Method(s) of bug discovery:
		- Unit test – The unit test conducted showed that the function fails to provide correct 
		number of hand count after playing card.  No other bugs were detected.
		- Random test – Out of the 1000 tests conducted, 0 tests were successful. The function 
		produces 100% failure.

	- Cause(s): One bug discovered in smithyEffect() is that the drawCard() function is repeated in 
	a for-loop 4 times instead of 3 times. This means the player is actually gaining 4 new cards 
	instead of 3, dictated by the game’s instructions.

			//+3 Cards
			for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
			{
				drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
			}

	- Effect(s): Player ends up with one extra card and has an extra chance of winning.

3. Village Card:

	- Bug: Incorrect hand count after having played card.

	- Description: After having played Village, player should draw 1 card from deck, gain 2 more 
	actions, and discard played card, ending with the same hand count before plyaing.

	- Method(s) of bug discovery:
		- Unit test – The unit test conducted showed that the function fails to provide correct number 
		of hand count after playing card.  No other bugs were detected.

	- Cause(s): One bug discovered in villageEffect() is that the card played is never discarded.

			//discard played card from hand
			//discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);

	- Effect(s): Player ends up with one additional card in hand.
